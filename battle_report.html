    <h2>The game</h2>
    <h3>Turn one</h3>
    <p>
      We did a roll-off and I won so I would be going first. First of all, I had my command phase
      so I used my vox caster ability which the rolls gave me two sixes so I got two more command points
      I then moved my infantry in flanking maneuvers on the objective points either side of the board.
      After that, I began my shooting phase. First of all, I used my leman russ demolisher cannon on the squad of terminators and the
      rolls were successfull killing all five of the terminators. I then fired the russ' lascannon at the squad of infernus marines successfully
      killing one. My cadian shock troops then fired their lasguns and flamers at the squad of infernus marines. The lasguns
      fail to wound but the flamer successfully deals one damage to the infernus marines.
       </p>
    <p>
      Then it was my opponent's turn. They moved their chaplain on bike towards the leman russ and moved the rest of their army toward 
      one of my shock troop squads. The infernus marines fire their flamers at a squad of cadian shock troops, killing one of them.
      The librarian in terminator armour uses smite against the Leman russ dealing six damage. The captian in terminator armour fires
      it's storm bolter at my shock troops killing one of them
    </p>
    <h3>Turn 3</h3>
    <p>
      My leman russ moves toward an objective marker and fires at the Captain in terminator armour. It deals nine damage 
      killing it. My cadian plasma guns fire at the squad of infernus marines and deal two damage killing one marine. I then charge the 
      squad killing one marine. We ran out of time to continue, so the game ended early.
    </p>
    <h3>Final score</h3>
    <p>
      Me 25-0 My opponent
