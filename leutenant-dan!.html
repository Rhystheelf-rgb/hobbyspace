       Here is a project I have been working on. Its a recreation of a scene in the film forrest gump. But with a warhammery twist.

          <h3>How I made It</h3>
          <p>
           For the famed leutenant dan I used an astra millitarum tank commander from the leman russ kit, Although, I did have to remove the harness he was standing in and then used an astra millitarum hand holding a vox and another hand to make it look like he is looking at his watch. I also had a spare guardsman model so he became private forrest gump. I used a hobby knife to create the bullet wound that is pictured as bleeding.I first primed the models chaos black before painting their fatigues zandri dust. Then, I used castellan green to paint the flak armour. For the skin tone, I used Rakarth flesh. The lasgun was painted castellan green and the barrel painted iron hands steel. After that, The white stripes were painted using white scar. I then covered the fatigue areas in agrax earthshade and the flak armour areas in nuln oil.
     I then glued them to the base and used two headtorches and a piece of paper to take the photo.
